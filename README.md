# image-sorter
A simple program that will sort .jpg and .nef files with a tkinter gui (this is my first attempt at a gui so bugs will definately be there!)

Warnings before use:
  1) The program iterates using the file lowest file name number first for each jpg and nef files; Therefore if you load up dsc_2333.jpg and dsc_2334.nef (rather than dsc_2333.nef)  then they will both be renamed to (name)-0000 due
  2) You may need to restart the program if you want to change the file names. (pending fix)
  3) Dont use special characters in the name of your files.
  
Other than that the script works fine for renaming hundreds of files straight from the camera in seconds! :)
